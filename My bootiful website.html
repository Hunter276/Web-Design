      <title>The Adventures of Jimmy</title>
   </head>
   <p>Jimmy has become very sociable as he begins to expand his horizons to discord. He is only using it to collect as many pings as he possibly can, this can make his friends very annoyed. By friends I mean max gets very triggered because of the pings. He frequently changes his username for the reasons that he does not feel the need to specify, he also has multiple fan accounts of discord for some reason. In servers he always feels the need to have a special role that only he can receive, he is quite the little shit. Jimmy is not his real name btw, it is a nickname given to his by his "friends", it started off being jam and then it ended up evolving to jimmy, it is also on its way to evolving to a new improved one called Jymen.</p>
